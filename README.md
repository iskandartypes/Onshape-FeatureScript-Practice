# Toy Features Made in Onshape

This repo contains the FeatureScript source for a couple of practice projects made in Onshape. Each folder contains a .fs file which has the source for that part, a copy of the specification I was following, and a README with some embedded gifs and a link to the public documents.

For quicker access, the public documents are also listed below.
