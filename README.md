#Toy Features Made in Onshape

This repo contains the FeatureScript source for a couple of practice projects made in Onshape. Each folder contains a .fs file (although they don't really have an extension), a copy of the specification I was following, and a README with some embedded gifs and a link to the public document.

Cheers.
